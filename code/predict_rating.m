% Returns the predicted ratings, given wordcounts and additional features.

% Usage:
%
%   RATES = PREDICT_RATING(XT_COUNTS, XQ_COUNTS, XT_ADDITIONAL_FEATURES, ...
%                         XQ_ADDITIONAL_FEATURES, YT);

% This is the function that we will use for checkpoint evaluations and the
% final test. It takes a set of wordcount and additional features and produces a
% ranking matrix as explained in the project overview.
%
% This function SHOULD NOT DO ANY TRAINING. This code needs to run in under
% 10 minutes. Therefore, you should train your model BEFORE submission, save
% it in a .mat file, and load it here.

% YOUR CODE GOES HERE
% THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE
N = size(Xq_counts, 1);

rates = int8(ones(N,1));
